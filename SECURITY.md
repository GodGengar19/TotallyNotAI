Please monitor versions coming out.
## Supported Versions

Only versions 5.0.x - 5.63 are currently being supported. If you are using one of the older versions, please stop using it and download a newer version between 5.0.x - 5.63

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.0.x   | :90% stable:       |
| 5.1.x   | :90% stable:       |
| 5.2.x   | :95% stable:       |
| = or < 5.3.x | :100% stable: |


Please don't use older versions than 5.0. x because they have stopped being watched and fixed... On Github, we get rid of being able to download older versions because we don't want
to put your safety at risk... Please only use our higher and stable versions, or we cannot guarantee safety from older versions.

Thank You!
